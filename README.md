## 📂 Projects

Ordered from most recent to oldest:

- **Credit Risk Analysis** (English 🇺🇸)  
  Applied statistical and machine learning techniques to assess credit risk based on financial data.  
  [View Project](./Credit%20Risk%20Analysis)

- **Stellar Age Prediction (Predicción de edades estelares)** (Spanish 🇪🇸)  
  Developed predictive models to estimate stellar ages using astrophysical datasets. Combines astronomy knowledge with machine learning methods, as part of the *Experimental Astrophysics (UC)* course.
