# Data Science Portfolio - ``cscheiding``

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio. This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills in **Machine Learning using Python**. Each folder corresponds to an individual project, with its own Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Projects

Ordered from most recent to oldest:

- **Dimensionality Reduction with Neural Networks for Predictive Analysis of Fraudulent Job Ads** (English 🇺🇸)  
  Applied dimensionality reduction using neural networks (autoencoders) to improve predictive analysis of fraudulent job postings.  
  Includes pre-processing (feature selection, encoding, scaling), class balancing with SMOTE-NC, logistic regression baseline, and comparison of performance after constructing a latent representation.

- **Credit Risk Analysis** (English 🇺🇸)  
  Applied statistical and machine learning techniques to assess credit risk based on financial data.  
  [View Project](./2%20Credit%20Risk%20Analysis)

- **Stellar Age Prediction (Predicción de edades estelares)** (Spanish 🇪🇸)  
  Developed predictive models to estimate stellar ages using astrophysical datasets. Combines astronomy knowledge with machine learning methods, as part of the *Experimental Astrophysics (UC)* course.

- **Additional Projects**  
  More projects will be added over time, covering topics such as data visualization, predictive modeling and automation.
